# Vibe Coding Hackathon Prompts

This file contains useful prompts for participants to use with Vibe Coding during the hackathon. Each prompt is designed to help you create different aspects of your project, from requirements to implementation.

## How to Use These Prompts

1. Copy the prompt you need
2. Paste it into your Vibe Coding interface
3. Modify any paths or project-specific details as needed
4. Run the prompt

> **Important**: The prompts use specific folder naming conventions with numeric prefixes (e.g., "1-SystemRequirements") to ensure folders appear in the correct order in file explorers. Please keep these naming conventions when creating your own project.

## 1. Generate Business Requirements

```
Application: [NAME]
With the information in the preliminary documents (like meeting transcripts or project briefs), please craft a set of business requirements for the application. Include:

1. System Overview
2. Core Requirements
3. Technical Requirements
4. Performance Requirements
5. Constraints
6. Success Criteria

Save the output in a new folder called "1-SystemRequirements". Use this exact folder name to maintain proper sorting order.
